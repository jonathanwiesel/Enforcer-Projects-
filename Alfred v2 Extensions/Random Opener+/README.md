Random Opener+
=================

***
Open a random file in a given directory.

**Unlike the original version of Random Opener, Plus version makes a shuffle datafile so no file gets opened twice unless all of them have been opened** 

To install just [download][download] and doble click the *.alfredworkflow* file.   

~~Then you MUST specify the directory from which the files are gonna be chosen in the script's *"DIR"* variable.~~ 

~~*DIR="/path/to/directory/"*~~


~~Optionally specify other place to store the shuffle file in the *"shuffleFile"* variable.~~

~~*shuffleFile="/Documents/randomOpener.dat"*~~ 

To run just type *"random open"* in Alfred bar. 
A random file within the given directory will be open and will not be randomly selected unless every other file has been opened.

Reset and count options also available.

**Update: new "current" command to open random file in current Finder window.**

**Update 2: better setup now!     
To setup your directory just type *"randomsetup full_path_to_your_directory"*, or even better, type only *"randomsetup"* and your frontmost Finder window's open directory will be selected**
