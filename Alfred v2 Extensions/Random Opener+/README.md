Random Opener+
=================

***
Open a random file in a given directory.

**Unlike the original version of Random Opener, Plus version makes a suffle datafile so no file gets opened twice unless all of them have been opened** 

To install just [download][download] and doble click the *.alfredworkflow* file.   
Then you MUST specify the directory from which the files are gonna be chosen in the script's *"DIR"* variable. 

*DIR="/path/to/directory/"*


Optionally specify other place to store the shuffle file in the *"shuffleFile"* variable.

*shuffleFile="/Documents/randomOpener.dat"* 

To run just type *"random+ open"* in Alfred bar. 
A random file within the given directory will be open and will not be randomly selected unless every other file has been opened.

Reset and count options also available.

***Update: new "current" command to open random file in current Finder window.***
