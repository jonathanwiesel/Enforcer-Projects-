Screenshootr
===========

A better way to take screenshots.  
Because Command-Shift-3 is too long ;)

To install just doble click the *.alfredextension* file 

To take full screenshot type *"ss s"* in Alfred bar.  

To take screenshot of selected window or draw selection just type *"ss"* in Alfred bar and then make your selection.  

The screenshots will be saved on your desktop.
