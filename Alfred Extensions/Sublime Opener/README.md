Sublime Opener
=================

***
Open selected file with Sublime Text 2.

To install just [download][download] and doble click the *.alfredextension* file.*

To use just select in Finder the file you want to open, then launch Alfred bar and type *"subop"*.

You can also assign this extension to a hotkey and just select the file then press the hotkey to open in Sublime Text (I prefer this)

*You need to get a [Powerpack Alfred License][PP] to install extensions
