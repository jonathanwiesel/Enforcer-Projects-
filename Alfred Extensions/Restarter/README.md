Restarter
=================

***
Restart process/application by name. 

To install just doble click the *.alfredextension* file.

To run just type *"rkill application_Name"* in Alfred bar.   

***Note that this extension doesn't quit the application nicely, it's a kill and open again.***

***Update:*** Now can kill applications that needed to be reffered internally by its PID (like Firefox) 
and those stubborn applications (like VLC) that needs to be killed with kill -9
