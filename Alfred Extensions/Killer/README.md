Killer
=================

***
Kill process/application by name. 

To install just doble click the *.alfredextension* file.

To run just type *"kill application_Name"* in Alfred bar.

***Update:*** Now can kill applications that needed to be reffered internally by its PID (like Firefox) 
and those stubborn applications (like VLC) that needs to be killed with kill -9

***Update 2:*** Now can kill Xcode processes suite (although new launchd child processes respawn)
