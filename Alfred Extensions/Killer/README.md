Killer
=================

***
Kill process/application by name. 

To install just doble click the *.applescript* file.

To run just type *"kill application_Name"* in Alfred bar.

This extension may not work for you because it uses the *"sudo"* command without a password

If you want this extensions to work, you'll need to disable the *"sudo"* password request or remove the *"sudo"* command and leave the *"killall"*, this limits the extension to only kill processes owned by the current user.

You can follow the steps to disable the *sudo* password request **[from here][macworld]**
